This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML bug involving the manipulation of the `innerHTML` property.  The script attempts to modify the `innerHTML` of an element that does not exist in the DOM.  Browsers handle this gracefully without throwing an error, but this can lead to unpredictable results and make debugging difficult. The solution shows how to safely modify innerHTML only if the element exists.
